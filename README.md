# Time-Series-Analysis



As part of my course, Regression Analysis of Temporal Processes, I completed the following analysis. Hypothesis testing, Regression modeling, and commentary are all included in the following files:

1. I performed trend analysis on data from the General Social Survey from 1988-2012 using R.


2. I performed regressions--OLS, Random Effects, and Fixed Effects--on GSS data using R.

3. I performed a multivariate Time Series and used ARIMA on GSS data using R.
